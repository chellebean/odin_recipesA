    <h3>Quick and Easy Chicken Enchilada Casserole</h3>

    <p>This is a go to meal beloved by all members of my family. What is there not to love about cheesy creamy enchilada goodness?
        We usually make refried beans and Spanish or Mexican rice as sides to create a full meal.
    </p>
    <p>I actually got this recipe from my aunt. I owe my family and friends favorite recipe to her. It is fairly easy
        to make and creates plenty of leftovers for another night's dinner or a few lunches.
