    <h3>A Very Cheesy Americanized Stuffed Shells Recipe</h3>
    <p>This has long been a family favorite. My husband and I make it every time we go up to the family cabin. 
        It is cheesy rich American spin on an Italian dish that goes beyond just the normal spaghetti or lasagna.</p>
     <p>Over the years we have adjusted the recipe using a bit more cheese and adding hot italian sausage
          to make it uniquely our own. We encourage everyone to put their own twist on our favorite meal.
